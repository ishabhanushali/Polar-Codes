Studied the algorithm behind the technology of polar codes used in communication for 5G NR
nowadays and written a basic workable code and plotted performance results on SNR, Bit Error Rate, etc.

Implemented SCL, SCL-List, and SCL-CRC encoding decoding techniques and plotted their comparison results as well.
